My 3rd portfolio project which features React and Tailwind CSS.

This React app calculates the ridgeline height for 33 different tarp configurations based on 21 types of tarp shelters given user-supplied body dimensions and tarp size. It also returns whether or not you can 1) sit on the ground under the tarp and 2) sit in your chair under the tarp.

This application would be of interest to bushcrafters, wilderness survivalists, backpackers and campers.

This is personal project since I practice bushcraft and wilderness survival techniques. Check out the [live version](https://timely-longma-59205e.netlify.app/) on Netlify.

## Features

1. The `Results` page lists the ridgeline height, resulting lean angle for each tarp design that fits your height. It also calculates whether or not you have room to sit on the ground and/or in your chair under the tarp.
1. The `Configs` page has information on each configuration like the number of tie points you need and where you need to fold your tarp.
1. The app alculates the height for user's ridgeline or ridge pole, sleeping clearance, sitting clearance, chair sitting clearance, and diagonal sleeping clearance.
1. For the time being I have a `Calcs` page which shows all the calculations for the tarp configurations. I may remove that page if it doesn't make sense to have it.
